The authors address three major challenges in existing EEG-based AD detection methods: the lack of large-scale datasets, limited generalizability across subjects, and difficulty adapting to heterogeneous data. To tackle these issues, they curate the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,238 subjects and 427.81 hours of recordings. The proposed LEAD model features a gated temporal-spatial Transformer that can handle EEG recordings with arbitrary lengths, channel configurations, and sampling rates. Additionally, they introduce a subject-regularized training strategy and employ medical contrastive learning for pre-training on 13 datasets (4 AD and 9 non-AD neurological disorders) before fine-tuning on 5 AD datasets. LEAD achieves the best average ranking across all 20 evaluations on 5 downstream datasets, substantially outperforming existing approaches including state-of-the-art EEG foundation models.",
